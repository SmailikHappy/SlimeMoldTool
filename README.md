# SlimeMoldTool, but technically a skeleton editing tool

This project implements a new editor mode with 2 tools:
- **Skeleton Editor** - allows the user to place points and connect them with lines
- **Mesh Editor** - can generate mesh in the editor from the points and lines

> *Reminder, that is the intended usage and that's how I used it in our team's project.*
> *But as a developer, you can use it for your own purposes in any way you want.*
